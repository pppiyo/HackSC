# PillBuddy
## Inspiration
One of our team members, who previously worked as a pharmacy technician, shared her experiences interacting with patients. She noticed that a significant number of elderly patients, especially those on multiple medications, struggled to find key information about their prescriptions, like the name, purpose, or prescription number. Many relied heavily on the pill’s visual appearance to identify it. Since most of these patients weren't very tech-savvy, they’d typically call the pharmacy for help, requiring pharmacists to conduct time-consuming manual searches to identify the pills in question. Inspired by this challenge, we came up with an idea: using AI to help quickly narrow down the possible pills patients describe, making the process much more efficient.

## What it does

- Helps elderly patients identify their medications through simple voice and/or text inputs.
- Assists pharmacy staffs, pharmacy techs, and pharmacists shortlist the pills patient was talking about.

Please bear with me if my voice sounded drowsy, that's because I was. Try working 10 hours intensively and that's what you got. I enjoyed the whole process though :)

## How we built it

- Using the DAIN platform, Typescript Language, Github for coding collaboration.

## Challenges we ran into

- Finding a meaningful problem to work on
- Quickly learn AI development and DAIN platform from scratch
- Define the scope of project based on limited time and resources

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Successfully pinpointed a valuable pain point and pull it out.
- Great efficiency thanks to DAIN.
- _**Amazing teammates**_ and smooth collaboration process.
- Last but not least, _**We built a meaningful & working AI product within only one day!!!!**_

## What we learned

- Utilizing product management to build a product efficiently within the constraints given
- How to use DAIN
- How to code with Typescript
- Communication skills
- How to build a first AI product

## What's next for PillBuddy

- Catch on some sleep. 
- Further explore pain points on both senior patients and pharmacy ends.
- Develop new features including but not limited to pill image recognition, pharmacy confirmation platform, payment functionality and delivery.
- Integrate with pharmacy databases to help customize search experiences.
